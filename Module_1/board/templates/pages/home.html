    <h3>About My Profile Image</h3>
    <p>
        The professional headshot you see was created using AI image generation early in 2024. 
        I needed a professional photo for LinkedIn, and I did not have one.
        Instead of buying a suit, and getting a professional photo, I setup a local instance
        of the Fooocus repo. I took ten selfies as reference photos, and spent about 10 hours
        generating photos on my computer with an AMD GPU. I obtained a newfound appreciation for 
        CUDA, and have since gotten an Nvidia GPU.

    <div class="tech-note">
        <p><strong>Were you fooled by this AI Photo?</strong> The most "AI" feature of this photo 
        is the cool lightbar it added on the right. I was prompting for "Professional Lighting", 
        and it added this random beam of light which I LOVE.</p>
