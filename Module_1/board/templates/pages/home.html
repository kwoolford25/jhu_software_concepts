            Welcome to my personal website! I'm an MLOps Engineer passionate about building 
            intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. With experience in machine learning 
            operations, I focus on bridging the gap between data science and production-ready systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            My expertise includes deploying and managing machine learning models, building data 
            pipelines, and creating robust infrastructure for AI applications. I'm particularly 
            interested in natural language processing and conversational AI systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to 
            open-source projects, or enjoying outdoor activities.
